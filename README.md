The final assignment in the Web Project course from the first semester of my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

The assignment involved identifying a social or technological problem and a solution to the problem.
The website intended to: 
* explain why the problem was important from a social or technological perspective.
* describe how the problem related to the solution that we identified.
* describe what the solution was.

This single page website features a media player, navigation, light and dark themes, text magnification and other content meant to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.
