				</div>
				<div class="textBox2">
					<h3>Cities and the disabled</h3>
					<p> Cities pose an even greater number of challenges to people with some form of disability. </p>
					<p> Several issues within architectural and infrastructural designs cause people with disabilities to be less mobile than and more dependent on other people.

					<h3>Planning for disabilities</h3>
					<p> While architects and urban planners will likely have to consider these issues for future projects, <em>we</em> as developers must ask ourselves: <span class=”quotation”>“Can we use technology to help our societies overcome these issues, and perhaps even rectify them?”</span> </p>

				<h2>Breaking Barriers</h2>
				<div class="textBoxR">
					<h3>The present and the future</h3>
					<p> While some apps exist to guide wheelchair users and blind people through cities, they must utilize the areas that are already accessible, largely avoiding many of the challenges. The goal of Urban Access is to give City Councils and relevant organizations, and perhaps private businesses, concrete information about where inaccessibility has occurred, and what specifically needs to be fixed. All leading to our ultimate vision of a 100% accessible city. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="textBox">
					<h3>Communicate the issues</h3>
					<p> Urban Access provides its users with the ability and opportunity to report the obstacles they face on their ventures through the city. Using GPS and photographic technologies, in combination with short written or recorded descriptions, users are able to send accurate reports of a wide variety of encountered barriers. </p>

				<div class="textBoxR">
					<h3>Assistance from city to city</h3>
					<p> While the ultimate goal of Urban Access is to transform every obstacle in our cities, we strive to provide assistance on every step of the journey. We make sure that our users can request help in any event that they cannot, for example enter a building, ascend a flight of stairs or access public transportation. The availability of the service depends on an active partnership within the city, and therefore is not currently available in every location.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="textBox">
					<h3>Empowering the citizen</h3>
					<p> The main functionality of the app is available for free, as it’s designed to be a tool of empowerment to people with disabilities; allowing them to directly impact the cities they live in or visit. The paid service of requesting help puts users in direct contact with Urban Access’ local partners, whether they be public employees, organizations dealing with accessibility, local businesses or a sole proprietorship. These relations will vary from city to city, depending on local initiatives and projects. </p>
